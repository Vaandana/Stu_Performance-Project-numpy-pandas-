# 🎓 Student Performance Data Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes student academic performance using Python. The goal is to uncover how factors like study time, absences, parental support, and extracurricular activities influence final grades.

## 📁 Dataset Features

- `StudentID`: Unique identifier  
- `Age`: Age of the student  
- `Gender`: Encoded (0 = Female, 1 = Male)  
- `Ethnicity`: Encoded categorical values  
- `ParentalEducation`: Education level of parents (encoded)  
- `StudyTimeWeekly`: Weekly study time  
- `Absences`: Number of absences  
- `Tutoring`: Attending tutoring (0/1)  
- `ParentalSupport`: Support rating from parents  
- `Extracurricular`: Participates in extracurricular activities  
- `FinalGrade`: Final academic performance score

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Identify trends and influencing factors for academic performance  
- Use visualizations to represent findings clearly

## 📊 Visualizations Used

- **Bar Plots** – Average grades by study time, parental support, etc.  
- **Count Plots** – Gender, tutoring, extracurricular participation  
- **Box Plots** – Distribution of grades by gender, support, etc.  
- **Heatmap** – Correlation among numeric features  
- **Line Plots** – Study time vs. grades trend  
- **Pair Plots** – Relationships among multiple variables  
- **KDE & Histogram Plots** – Grade and study time distributions  
- **Scatter Plots** – Absences vs. grades, age vs. performance

## 📈 Key Observations

- Students with higher **weekly study time** performed better overall.  
- **Parental support** and **tutoring** had a clear positive impact.  
- Students with **high absenteeism** tended to have lower grades.  
- Gender and ethnicity showed minor variations but weren’t major factors.  
- **Extracurricular activities** had mixed impact based on support level and time balance.
