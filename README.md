## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Identify trends and influencing factors for academic performance  
- Use visualizations to represent findings clearly

---

## 📊 Visualizations Used

- **Bar Plots** – Average grades by study time, parental support, etc.  
- **Count Plots** – Gender, tutoring, extracurricular participation  
- **Box Plots** – Distribution of grades by gender, support, etc.  
- **Heatmap** – Correlation among numeric features  
- **Line Plots** – Study time vs. grades trend  
- **Pair Plots** – Relationships among multiple variables  
- **KDE & Histogram Plots** – Grade and study time distributions  
- **Scatter Plots** – Absences vs. grades, age vs. performance

---

## 📈 Key Observations

- Students with higher **weekly study time** performed better overall.  
- **Parental support** and **tutoring** had a clear positive impact.  
- Students with **high absenteeism** tended to have lower grades.  
- Gender and ethnicity showed minor variations but weren’t major factors.  
- **Extracurricular activities** had mixed impact based on support level and time balance.
